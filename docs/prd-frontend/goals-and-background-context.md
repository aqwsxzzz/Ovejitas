# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver a mobile-first PWA that works offline and syncs seamlessly
- Provide an intuitive, fast UI for non-technical farm owners
- Support all backend functionality (FR1-FR9 from backend PRD)
- Achieve sub-3s initial load on 3G networks

## Background Context
This frontend PRD complements the [backend PRD](./prd.md). It defines the technical implementation for the user-facing web application that farm owners will use to manage their animals and operations.
